/**
 * Per-runner CAPABILITY TABLE for the tier-3 backup/restore subagent.
 *
 * The backup "brain" (gate, pattern matching, prompt building, verification)
 * is runner-agnostic, but what each runner CLI can actually be provisioned
 * with is not: hermes gets a filtered per-call home (only the action's MCP
 * server, tool schema narrowed to the learned capture_tools), claude can be
 * handed a filtered --mcp-config file, and codex/openclaw currently get no
 * MCP at all. Silently dropping those features per-runner is how backups
 * fabricate: a subagent INSTRUCTED to read pre-state through an MCP it does
 * not have will either flail (burning its turn budget) or invent a
 * confident-empty recovery.
 *
 * This table is the single source of truth the shared brain consults so it
 * can DEGRADE HONESTLY instead: skip tool narrowing where unsupported, tell
 * the prompt when the runner has no MCP (so the subagent is told not to
 * fabricate), and refuse to record confident remote recoveries produced
 * without MCP access (see runSubagentBackup's verification gate).
 *
 * Provisioning itself (filteredHermesHome / filteredClaudeMcpConfig) stays in
 * subagent.ts — this module only answers WHAT a runner supports, cheaply and
 * without side effects, so both the prompt builder and the invocation builder
 * agree on one story.
