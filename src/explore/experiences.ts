/**
 * Recovery experiences — per-MCP-server learned BACKUP SKILL.

 * drift). Many destructive remote actions have a far cheaper reversible
 * counterpart — e.g. "delete a post" → "set it to private/draft", which
 * preserves the original entity in place. This module stores those
 * model-extracted patterns per server (the learned skill for backing up
 * that server well) and is read by the backup subagent prompt so it
 * prefers the cheap reversal when one applies.
 *
 * Modeled on NVIDIA ToolShield's per-server "experiences", but for
 * recoverability rather than safety.
